# Overview
Resource Hacker™ is a resource editor for 32bit and 64bit Windows® applications. It's both a **resource compiler** (for .rc files), and a **decompiler** - enabling viewing and editing of resources in executables (*.exe; *.dll; *.scr; etc) and compiled resource libraries (*.res, *.mui). While Resource Hacker™ is primarily a GUI application, it also provides many options for compiling and decompiling resources from the command-line.
